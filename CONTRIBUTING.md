# Contributing

Thanks for helping with the replication work.

## Workflow

1. Create a branch for your work.
2. Keep changes focused and small.
3. Update docs if you change behavior or assumptions.
4. Share results in `project/replica/outputs/` (do not commit large data).

## Style

- Use clear filenames and consistent naming.
- Prefer scripts for training and notebooks for analysis.
- Keep paths configurable and avoid hard-coding machine-specific paths.

## Before You Share

- Run or at least sanity-check notebooks you changed.
- Note expected runtime and outputs in the relevant README.
